Create source package (only using cmake):
-----------------------------------------

After having run cmake and make as described in the section "Install using
cmake" in the INSTALL file, running either of the following commands in the
build directory will build a .tar.bz2 file containing the complete source
in the build directory:

make package_source
make dist

Create debian package for own use (only using cmake):
-----------------------------------------------------

After having run cmake and make as described in the section "Install using
cmake" in the INSTALL file, running the following command in the build
directory will build a .deb package in the build directory:

cpack -G DEB

You may specify the architecture for which the .deb is created as follows:

cpack -G DEB -D CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_ARCHITECTURE="amd64"

Note that the debian package created by this command probably does NOT
satisfy the requirements for inclusion in the debian repositories.  But
you can still use the debian package for easily installing and removing
ktikz on your own computer (if you run a debian based distribution).

Create debian package (only using qmake) (old version):
-------------------------------------------------------

The Ubuntu/debian package infrastructure can be found in ./debian
In order to compile a releasable package, you need a pbuilder
environment. Please follow the Ubuntu packaging guide:
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide/Complete#The Personal Builder: pbuilder

A debian package is created in two steps. The first step is to create
a source package which describes all changes relative to the release
tarball. Create a release tarball using:
make package

Untar this release tarball to /tmp and copy the debian directory
cp qtikz-VERSION.tar.gz /tmp
tar --directory /tmp -xf qtikz-VERSION.tar.gz
rsync -r --exclude=.svn debian /tmp/qtikz-VERSION
cd /tmp/qtikz-VERSION

The next step is to create the source package
cd /tmp/qtikz-VERSION
debuild -S

Now you should have a .dsc file in /tmp. The next step is to compile
the binary package using pbuilder:
cd /tmp
pbuilder --build qtikz_VERSION.dsc

If the build finished successfully you should have the result in
/var/cache/pbuilder/result/qtikz_VERSION_ARCH.deb
