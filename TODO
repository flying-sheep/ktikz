- Print image
- In multiple image mode, allow to save and export only the current image
- Clicking an item in the TikZ commands dock widget should not insert
  it, but only select it.  Pressing an Insert button would then do the
  actual insertion.  There should also be a Help button which opens the
  TikZ manual at the page where the selected item is explained.
- Make a graphical tool for editing the XML file containing the TikZ
  commands similar to keditbookmarks
- Create a new process for each window opened by the "New" action.
- Remove bug in KDE version in which the template is not loaded if the
  contents do not start with \documentclass (the mimetype is then not
  recognized as text/plain).
- Check whether the file has changed when ktikz gets the focus, and also
  when saving or closing (similar to kwrite).
- Download files which are \included or \inputted in remote template files
  or remote pgf files to the temporary directory (could be dangerous when
  the user is still editing the \input command).
- Add the directory in which the pgf file is located to TEXINPUTS
- Complete tikzcommands.xml:

  The following sections of the TikZ manual are implemented:
  Section 13 complete (except \pgfextra)
  Section 14 almost complete (except preaction=<options>, postaction=<options>,
    decorate, decoration=<zigzag/...>)
  Section 15 partially
