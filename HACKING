This file contains notes for developers of ktikz.

Generating the translation source files:
----------------------------------------

When you add/change/remove translatable strings in the C++ code, you must
recreate the translation source files (app/*.ts and po/*.po).  You must build
the Qt-only version as described in INSTALL (but don't do 'make install' yet).
Then run
  make ts
to generate an updated version of the .ts files.  Note that running
  lupdate app.pro
in the app directory is only sufficient if you have not changed the file
app/tikzcommands.xml (if you have changed this file, 'make ts' must be run
so that the translatable strings in this file are also added to the .ts files).

If you build the KDE version, the above steps must also be accomplished, but
additionally you must run
  ./extract_messages.sh
in the po directory to get the strings that only appear in the KDE version.

The app/*.ts files can be edited using Qt Linguist, the po/*.po files can be
edited using KDE's Lokalize.

After editing the translation source files, they will be compiled and installed
when you run (both for the Qt-only and the KDE version):
  make
  sudo make install

Generating the documentation:
-----------------------------

For the KDE version, all you need to do is edit the doc/*.docbook files.

For the Qt-only version, the procedure is more complicated.  After you have
edited the *.docbook files, you must run
  ./generate-qt-doc.sh
in the doc directory in order to regenerate the file doc/index.html.  However,
if the documentation is edited or if some features are added, then it might be
necessary to change the "sed" lines in generate-qt-doc.sh before running this
script.

After generating the documentation, they will be compiled and installed when
you run (both for the Qt-only and the KDE version):
  make
  sudo make install

Generating the icons:
---------------------

The app/icons/qtikz.svg and app/icons/ktikz.svg icons are derived from the
accessories-text-editor icon in KDE's Oxygen icon set, in Inkscape the "Lorem
ipsum..." text is removed and the QTikZ/KTikZ text is added using the Prociono
font (http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Prociono).  The PNG versions of these
icons in different sizes are all obtained by opening the SVG versions in the
GIMP, selecting the appropriate size when the SVG file is opened and saving
the file as PNG.  The Windows qtikz.ico version is obtained by converting
qtikz.svg online at http://www.convertico.com (the free png2ico does not give
a result of similar quality).  The other icons (except qt-logo-22.png which is
obtained from Qt) are obtained from KDE's Oxygen icon set.
